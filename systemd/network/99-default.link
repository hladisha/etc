# This machine is most likely a virtualized guest, where the old persistent
# network interface mechanism (75-persistent-net-generator.rules) did not work.
# This file disables /lib/systemd/network/99-default.link to avoid
# changing network interface names on upgrade. Please read
# /usr/share/doc/udev/README.Debian.gz about how to migrate to the currently
# supported mechanism.
